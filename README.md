This project is a clone of the tutorial provided by React Official Documentation.
New features were provided in the version developed by me, 
for example, a screen delay for nearly 5 seconds to declare the winner and then clear the board starting a new game.

Fewer enhancements should be made when working again on this project:
1. Oline peer playing using a backend server.
2. Counter for winns for each player.
3. History for only one move prior to the current move
